# responsive-portfolio-template
Simple dynamic portfolio page using [Angular.js](https://angularjs.org/). 
Users can search for a particular work, and sort works by year or title.
There are two views, the thumbnail search view and the work details view.
This project is adapted from the [Lynda.com](https://www.lynda.com) tutorial [Up and Running with AngularJS 1](https://www.lynda.com/AngularJS-tutorials/Up-Running-AngularJS/154414-2.html?org=ppld.org), by [Ray Villalobos](http://www.lynda.com/Ray-Villalobos/832401-1.html).
